This repository is dedicated to learners aiming to master JavaScript, which is essential in the developmental phases of a website. I have provided material about Regular Expressions, Arrays, JS Event Handlers and Events. In order to challenge learners, an assignment has been provided, with solutions.

## Resources Used:-

- XAMPP Web Server

- Brackets IDE

- JDK (Java Development Kit)

## Functionality of the Repository:-
JavaScript is versatile and caters to the need of the programmer.Ask for any effect and it will be possible to implement through JavaScript.Truth be told,I had a lot of fun experimenting with the functions.

Here,I will be demonstrating Onload(),in  Onload.html

As you can see,it is a webpage within a webpage.It is made possible using a frame,displaying input fields for 'Name' and 'Email Address',along with a button,perforimg 'submit'
action.The frame window displays the secondary webpage linked using getElementbyId

Concepts Used:-

- getElementbyId - To get the frame's size and the example.html page.
 
 - JavaScript Function
 
->To run on your machine:-

- Download the codes (.html) pages from this repository

- Download and configure the XAMPP Server

- Move the downloaded files to the 'htdocs' folder under C:\XAMPP

- Click on the each to file to view it's practical demonstration


## Improvements:-

I am open towards learning more concepts in JavaScript,to enhance my Web Programming knowledge.What's included in here is pretty limited

This repository is open to the public,to collaborate and contribute.Get in touch with me and I would be more than happy
